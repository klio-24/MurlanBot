    "To generate *all possible combinations of triplets* from a hand of cards, we can build on the previous logic. Instead of just counting the number of triplets that can be formed, we will *actually generate each combination* of 3 cards for any rank that has 3 or more cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea:\n",
    "- First, we group the cards by rank.\n",
    "- For each rank with 3 or more cards, we generate all possible combinations of 3 cards using *combinatorics*.\n",
    "- We'll use Python's itertools.combinations to generate the combinations efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code to Output All Possible Triplet Combinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "from itertools import combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "def find_triplet_combinations(hand):\n",
    "    # Dictionary to count occurrences of each rank\n",
    "    rank_count = defaultdict(list)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Group cards by their rank (storing full card information)\n",

    "        rank = card[:-1]  # Extract the rank (remove the suit)\n",
    "        rank_count[rank].append(card)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # List to store all possible triplet combinations\n",
    "    triplet_combinations = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # For each rank, generate combinations of 3 cards if there are 3 or more cards\n",

    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "hand = ['7♠', '7♥', '7♦', '7♣', '5♠', '5♥', '2♣', '2♦', '10♠', '3♠']\n",

    "    print(triplet)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Grouping Cards by Rank*:\n",
    "   - We first group the cards by their rank (ignoring the suit), and store the full cards in a dictionary rank_count where the key is the rank, and the value is a list of cards of that rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Generate Combinations*:\n",
    "   - For each rank that has 3 or more cards, we use itertools.combinations to generate all possible combinations of 3 cards from that list. This function returns all unique triplets (combinations) of the cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Store and Return the Results*:\n",
    "   - We accumulate all the combinations in the list triplet_combinations and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the hand:\n",
    "python\n",
    "hand = ['7♠', '7♥', '7♦', '7♣', '5♠', '5♥', '2♣', '2♦', '10♠', '3♠']\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Group by rank*:\n",
    "   - {'7': ['7♠', '7♥', '7♦', '7♣'], '5': ['5♠', '5♥'], '2': ['2♣', '2♦'], '10': ['10♠'], '3': ['3♠']}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Generate Combinations*:\n",
    "   - For rank 7, the list of cards is ['7♠', '7♥', '7♦', '7♣']. We can generate the combinations:\n",
    "     - ('7♠', '7♥', '7♦')\n",
    "     - ('7♠', '7♥', '7♣')\n",
    "     - ('7♠', '7♦', '7♣')\n",
    "     - ('7♥', '7♦', '7♣')\n",
    "   - For other ranks, there are fewer than 3 cards, so no combinations are generated for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output for the Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "('7♠', '7♥', '7♦')\n",
    "('7♠', '7♥', '7♣')\n",
    "('7♠', '7♦', '7♣')\n",
    "('7♥', '7♦', '7♣')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Case:\n",
    "For a hand like:\n",
    "python\n",
    "hand = ['7♠', '7♥', '7♦', '7♣', '7♠', '7♥']\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, only two triplets of 7s can be generated:\n",
    "python\n",
    "('7♠', '7♥', '7♦')\n",
    "('7♠', '7♥', '7♣')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- *Time Complexity*:  \n",
    "  - Counting occurrences takes *O(n)* where n is the number of cards in the hand.\n",
    "  - Generating combinations for each rank involves iterating over the possible triplet combinations, which for each rank with m cards involves *O(m choose 3) = O(m^3)* combinations.\n",
    "  - So, the overall complexity is *O(n + m^3)* where m is the number of cards of any specific rank (and m <= n).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- *O(n)* to store the cards and combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution should be efficient for most reasonable hands and provides the full list of combinations of triplets from a given hand of cards.\n"
