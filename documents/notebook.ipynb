    "Overall process:\n",
    "-\tMake simple game simulation, where the bot just plays heuristically doing the lowest possible move\n",
    "-\tCreate an MCTS model for optimal play\n",
    "-\tMake a website that allows you to play the game with a mouse, and the bot’s moves are demonstrated too\n",
    "-\tHost the game on microservices\n",
    "-\tWrite report, cleanup github\n",
    "-\tPost linkedin\n",
    "\n",
    "To Do:\n",
    "- DEFINITELY DO A FULL WRITE UP WITH UML, SYSTEM DIAGRAMS, FULL EXPLANATIONS ETC. it will help with your understanding\n",
    "-\ton the website add a display that shows how many times its won and lost\n",
    "-\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQLkPgkLMNg&ab_channel=Wanieru \n",
    "-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB-NJtNERBQ + https://www.harrycodes.com/blog/monte-carlo-tree-search - main example for MCTS\n",

    "To add LATER:\n",
    "- determine optimal card to give for second round if AI wins\n",
    "- implement policy/value network or general ML with relevant loss functions\n",
    "- implement a probability of winning at each turn just like alphago\n",
    "-\thttps://www.catsatcards.com/Games/Murlan.htm lay out rules on the website in a logical way\n",
    "- from the Wanieru video, look into the Information Set card mixing bluffing thing more, and how you can exploit the behaviours of the average murlan player\n",
    "-\tWould be interesting to see if the right ‘behaviours’ emerge from self-learning, e.g. putting your highest card down when you've got two cards left\n",
    "-\tRead this https://www.pagat.com/docs/sps2172.pdf\n",
    "-   http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/\n",
    "- skipping turn as a strategy\n",
    "- implement quads\n",
    "- implement straightsz \n",
    "- do an actual front end\n",
    "- watch a video on how the best go bot works (https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/alphago-how-it-works-technically-26ddcc085319 - read and fully understand this too) \n",
    "-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62nq4Zsn8vc the guy said the way you train your policy network is to train it to give the same outputs as your MCTS???"
